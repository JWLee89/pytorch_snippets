# pytorch_snippets

Simple snippets that will hopefully be useful to myself and others (for engineering or educational purposes)


## Getting started

To get started, you must have [poetry](git@github.com:python-poetry/poetry.git) installed in your development environment.
Afterwards, use poetry to install, update, manage dependencies and run scripts. 

Poetry is well-documented, so read their guides on [getting started](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/).
